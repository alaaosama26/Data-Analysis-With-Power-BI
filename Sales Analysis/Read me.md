# Sales Data Analysis
## Dataset
The dataset you will be using is a CSV file called sales_data.csv.
It contains information about sales made by a fictional company over the course of a year. The columns in the dataset are as follows:

- **Date:** The date of the sale (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
- **Product:** The name of the product sold.
**- Category**: The category of the product (e.g. "electronics", "clothing", etc.)
**- Price:** The price of the product (in USD)
**- Quantity:** The quantity of the product sold
**- Revenue:** The total revenue generated by the sale (i.e. price * quantity)

## Data Analysis Steps
**- Data Connection:** Efficiently import CSV files into the project environment to facilitate data processing tasks.
**- Data Cleaning:** 
       - Standardize category names by resolving discrepancies such as 'Bage' to 'Bag' and 'shoeses' to 'shoes'.
       - Employ merged queries to rectify null values within the price column.
       - Implement conditional column addition methodologies to address null values within the quantity and revenue columns, ensuring robust data quality.
**- Business Questions:**
      - What was the total revenue generated by the company over the course of the year?
      - Which product had the highest revenue? How much revenue did it generate?
      - What was the average price of a product sold by the company?
      - What was the total quantity of products sold by the company?
      - Which category had the highest revenue? How much revenue did it generate?
      - What was the average revenue per sale?
      - What was the total revenue generated in each quarter of the year? (i.e. Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
